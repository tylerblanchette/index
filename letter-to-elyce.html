					A Letter to Elyce
				</h1>
				<br>
				<p class="articlesubheading">Hey Elyce!</p>
				<br>
			
				<p class="articlemainp">It’s awesome to see your name in my inbox. Too bad I ended up moving back sooner than I should’ve received your letter. Nonetheless, I still enjoy our communication through snail mail. I think that receiving a handwritten letter from anyone is something special. So, I hope this letter will bring you a bit of sunshine into your day.</p>

				<p class="articlemainp">That’s too bad to hear about your classes getting merely cancelled. Ours of course were aswell. I find that online education is not nearly as valuable as in classroom education, and for that reason, I’ve considered taking the next semester away from schooling. If I end up taking two spring classes during the spring here, I should be able to skip the fall (sept – dec) semester.</p>

				<p class="articlemainp">I’ve moved back in with my parents, which was/is still hard to adapt to. They have VERY traditional values, and mine aren’t similar to theirs. There is some conflict at times, and I kind of think that they’re not super proud of me because I’m not in the career path that they wish I was in. I do at times experience some parental pressure from them. For example, they pushed me away from spending time in Australia and convinced me that an education is what I need right now. I’m still not sure if I made the right decision or not, but on the positive side, I did learn a ton this year that I wouldn’t have if I decided to come over. Not even speaking about academics! I began to produce music and learn music theory as a side hobby, finally bit the bullet and bought a camera (something that I’ve wanted to do for roughly 2 years now), and started to work on learning programming. Life is crazy, and has a million different paths, Its hard to tell what would’ve happened if I came to AUS. I do regret it a bit although. </p>

				<p class="articlemainp">I do think about you too! I was thinking the other day about how funny it was when we were on the Highway west of Jasper, super stressed out because we weren’t going to be in time for our arrival at the Mount Robson Visitor Centre. From my memory, I was speeding a bit, and worried that we weren’t going to make it. I was regretting spending time buying that stuff and a sub in Jasper. The wave of relief we had when we had the realization that BC time is 1 hour behind was comical. WHEW! So funny.</p>
				
				<p class="articlemainp">Damian and I are thinking about taking a trip to do a hiking trail too. I told him that he would love the Berg Lake Trail and I might take him back. </p>

				<p class="articlemainp">Other than that, I’m working away. Spending too much money on golf in Moose Jaw here. I still don’t have a job, but I’m saving funds living at home with parents. </p>
				
				<p class="articlemainp">My childhood bestfriend and I had a really really good talk yesterday, and he brought up a solid point. He is employed by the railroad in Canada; he drives trains. He has a side hustle too. I’m not sure if you’ve ever heard of it, but he livestreams video games on this website called ‘Twitch.Tv’. He has been working on it for about a year and some now. Today, his livestreams are really starting to get popular, he just reached about 7600 followers a few days ago. He has made over $2000USD in the month of May so far (today is May 22nd). Livestreaming is what he is passionate about (his plan A), and the railroad is his fallback (plan B). A few months back, he got laid off from the railroad and decided to ‘double down’ and livestream full time (40+ hours a week). One night, he luckily got recognized by a really famous person who sent his followers over to his stream. This helped him get recognition, and people started flocking to his livestream. A week after that, he got a call from the railroad who wanted him to come back to work. Because he has a mortgage, he decided to choose the railroad over livestreaming.</p>
				
				<p class="articlemainp">Yesterday, he brought up the point about safety nets, and how the safety and security of the railroad job was what ended up getting him to put down his Plan A and work his Plan B. So he worked for the railroad for another few months, not progressing much towards his plan A. Two months ago, (fortunately) he got laid off again. To this day, he’s still laid off, and livestreaming. He brought up the point of how at times when life get difficult, we get scared and anxious that things won’t work out. We put down our Plan A’s for the Plan B’s because they’re more secure. I can attest to this; I was planning on going to Australia, but was starting to get worried that things wouldn’t work out (I wouldn’t be able to find employment, or I would waste a lot of time and money not progressing towards something of value). I had my safety net in place (schooling), which I decided to take in the end. It was just too easy and available for me to take. This may have stopped me from realizing my full potential. I do regret it at times, but now I’m more aware of it.</p>

				

				<p class="articlemainp" style="padding-right: 60%;"><b>So I ask you;</b></p>
				<br>

				<p class="articlemainp"><b>what’s your plan A in life, and what is your safety net?</b></p>
				<p class="articlemainp"><b>Are you going where you want to go?</b></p>
				<p class="articlemainp"><b>Or are you just falling into the safety net because Plan A is too difficult?</b></p>
				<p class="articlemainp" style="padding-bottom: 3%;">I think this is a question that all of us should ask ourselves, in order to identify our safety nets and call ourselves out on our bullshit when things get too tough and we start to fall back into the safety net.</p>
				<p class="articlemainp" style="padding-right: 40%;">Glad to hear from you Elyce! I'll be waiting for your response.</p>
